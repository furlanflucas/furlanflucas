## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Lucas. I love buildingâ€‚scalable, high-performance and fault-tolerant systems. I specializeâ€‚in data engineering, analytics and automation & love optimizing workflows, debugging and building infrastructure that enables data-driven decisions.

I enjoy figuring out complex data challenges such as optimizing ETL pipelines, enhancingâ€‚data models, or increasing system efficiency. Curiosity, adaptability, andâ€‚resilience drive my problem-solving approach and all my uncertainties lead me to find a solution.

I firmly believe inâ€‚using AI to solve problems, improve documentation and help with debugging. AI is a part of my workflow, be it automate things, generating insightful documentation or speed upâ€‚troublesooting. I view it as aâ€‚productivity and ideation amplifier that will let engineers spend time on high-impact projects, not muddling through inefficiency.

Besides the technical capabilities, I think technology need to leadâ€‚the way in innovation, accessibility and ethical obligation. I want to work onâ€‚purposeful things, with teammates with whom I scale and share knowledge.

### ðŸ’¡ Core Values

âœ” **Resourceful** â€“ I figure things out, even when uncertain how they'llâ€‚adapt.
